# Rubik-s-Timer

This is an improved version of my original slap together timer. I hope to maintain much of the same functionality while keeping a simple and clean look. The front-end is made using ReactJS with some help from Bootstrap. The entire setup will be based around a Flask framework that takes and records times to a Mongo database.

Currently still in developement and so there are still many sections that remain incomplete.

To run, you will need to start the npm server is in the client folder, start mongodb, and also start the flask server.

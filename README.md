# Rubik-s-Timer

This is an improved version of my original slap together timer. I hope to maintain much of the same functionality while keeping a simple and clean look. The front-end is made using ReactJS with some help from Bootstrap. The entire setup will be based around a Flask framework that takes and records times to a MongoDB database. 

Currently still in developement and so there are still many sections that remain incomplete.

# Rubik-s-Timer

This is an improved version of my original slap together timer. I maintained much of the same functionality while keeping a simple and clean look. The front-end is made using ReactJS with some help from Bootstrap. The entire setup is be based around a Flask framework that takes and records times to a Mongo database. Graphing is done dynamically using Recharts.

To run, you simply need to run the command `num run dev` to start everything.
